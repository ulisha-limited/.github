Our Software is open source, meaning anyone can view, build, and test the code, no free trials, no locked demos. You can see exactly how it works, anytime (even tho our code might be disgusting). That was a figure of speech. While the source code is public, the software and it's content itself is licensed. This approach ensures transparency, security and credibility among developers, institutions and businesses while supporting sustainable development.
